# Course Description                    {#description}

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

~~~
This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process. 
It is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Improve a Design
- Communicate their Problem and Resulting Design
~~~

# Project Structure

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

~~~
Projects are organized around four assignments, each consistent of several milestones:

- [Assignment 1 - Project Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment1/)
- [Assignment 2 - Getting the Right Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment2/)
- [Assignment 3 - Getting the Design Right]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/)
- [Assignment 4 - Communicating the Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment4/)

Example project from prior offerings include: 

- [Aqueous](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/aqueous/)
- [IEP Connect](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/iepconnect/)
- [Ka-Ching](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/kaching/)
- [Soundscape](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/soundscape/)

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
However, these represent examples of strong work in this course.

~~~
The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- Group Project (__65%__)
  - Assignment 1, Project Proposal (__3%__)
  - Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design (__21%__)
    - Milestones (__6%__)
    - Final Report (__15%__)
  - Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right (__14%__)
    - Milestones (__4%__)
    - Final Report (__10%__)
  - Assignment 4, Communicating the Design (__15%__)
    - Milestones (__3%__)
    - Project Website (__4%__)
    - Video Prototype (__4%__)
    - Poster (__4%__)
  - Presentations (__12%__)
    - Getting the Right Design Presentation (__5%__)
    - Getting the Design Right Presentation (__5%__)
    - Individual Presentation Score (__2%__)
- Exam (__25%__)
- Individual Readings (__5%__)
- Participation (__5%__)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded. 
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
Wow us with your work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

# Submission                            {#submission}

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

~~~
Many assignments are due "the night before class". We will implement this in Canvas as 4:00am.

In order to be prepared to give you feedback, the course staff must have your submission in the morning.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.

Submissions should be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word). 
The PDF should be 'printable', containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.
