# Course Description

Provides an introduction to several major areas of HCI research. 
This course is a combination of readings and discussion, a small statistics lab, and a self-defined project.

This course is explicitly not focused on the design methods used in HCI practice. 
We briefly cover some of these methods near the end of the course, but our focus is on research. 
We do not assume a strong background in HCI (i.e., there is no undergraduate HCI prerequisite).

The course readings will require preparing reports on a combination of historic and more current papers. 
This will help you examine what the HCI community considers a meaningful contribution across a variety of problems, 
thus helping prepare you to understand and make meaningful contributions in these and other areas of HCI.

The course project will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities. 
You might choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology, 
or you might choose to design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.

We will emphasize open discussion and feedback in all aspects of the course.

# Project Structure

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

~~~
Projects are organized around four assignments, each consistent of several milestones:

- [Assignment 1 - Project Proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment1/)
- [Assignment 2 - Getting the Right Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment2/)
- [Assignment 3 - Getting the Design Right]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/)
- [Assignment 4 - Communicating the Design]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment4/)

Example project from prior offerings include: 

- [Aqueous](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/aqueous/)
- [IEP Connect](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/iepconnect/)
- [Ka-Ching](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/kaching/)
- [Soundscape](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/14au/projects/soundscape/)

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
However, these represent examples of strong work in this course.

# Readings

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

Assigned readings will generally consist of a historic framing paper and papers that are more current.
You are expected to read: (1) the historical framing paper, and (2) either one of the more current papers
(in other words, whichever seems more compelling or interesting to you). You obviously may choose to read all three.
The calendar will link to assigned readings and provide any day-specific revisions to this reading structure. 

You are expected to have read and considered the assigned readings prior to class,
as the in-class discussions are a critical component of this course.
To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we require posting thoughts and questions beforehand.

You can start a new discussion, participate in an existing discussion, or do a bit of both. 
You can discuss all of the assigned readings, or focus on a portion of the reading that you found most interesting. 
We will create Canvas discussion threads for each paper. 
If you have a thought or question that relates to multiple papers, post it wherever seems more appropriate.
The important part is that we can see intellectual effort in your forum participation, not just a simple paper summary.

Your participation in the forum discussion for each day will be graded on a scale from 0 to 3.

- 0: If you do not participate.
- 1: If your participation seems weak and does not convince us you read, understood, and considered the readings.
- 2: If your participation shows you read and understood the readings and had something interesting to say.
     This will be the most common grade.
- 3: Reserved for especially insightful participation.

In discussing readings, it is generally easy to find something to criticize in any piece of research. 
But focusing exclusively on the potential flaws of research is generally not productive. 
You will generally find it more intellectually worthwhile to focus on aspects of work that are particularly well done, 
new ideas are prompted by a piece of work, or what you might have done differently if you conducted the research. 
This will also lead to much more valuable discussions.

Potential topics for discussion are:

```
What idea or innovation enabled this research?
What more might be done based on that idea or innovation?
What new questions or research agendas are suggested by this research?
What would you have done differently with approximately the same resources available to the original authors?
What would you have done differently with half or ten times the resources available to the original authors?
How might this research have informed some other research you have seen?
```

As we note in [Submission](#submission), participation must be posted by the night before each class meeting. 
This ensures time to review discussion the next morning before class. 
Feel free to continue a discussion, even after class. But the grading cutoff will be the night before.

# Grading

`This page is still being developed, all content is subject to change`

~~~
The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

- Group Project (__65%__)
  - Assignment 1, Project Proposal (__3%__)
  - Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design (__21%__)
    - Milestones (__6%__)
    - Final Report (__15%__)
  - Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right (__14%__)
    - Milestones (__4%__)
    - Final Report (__10%__)
  - Assignment 4, Communicating the Design (__15%__)
    - Milestones (__3%__)
    - Project Website (__4%__)
    - Video Prototype (__4%__)
    - Poster (__4%__)
  - Presentations (__12%__)
    - Getting the Right Design Presentation (__5%__)
    - Getting the Design Right Presentation (__5%__)
    - Individual Presentation Score (__2%__)
- Exam (__25%__)
- Individual Readings (__5%__)
- Participation (__5%__)

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded. 
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
Wow us with your work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

# Submission

Submissions will be coordinated using Canvas:

<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1021534/>

Many assignments are due "the night before class". We will implement this in Canvas as 4:00am the day of class.
This gives staff time to review submissions before class. 
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable, risking zero credit.
