# Overview

Term projects will be a major focus of this course. The project will require hands-on experience with HCI research. You can choose to design and implement a new piece of HCI technology, or to design and execute a study of existing technology with HCI research implications. We expect that most students will do the project in groups of two, but individual projects or groups of three are possible. The project consists of a __proposal__, a pair of __milestones__, and a __final report__.

The course project is worth `99.9999%` of your overall course grade.

# Proposal

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, January 12, 2016

Proposals consist of __two parts__: a short written document, and a short presentation.

### Written document

Please prepare a one-page document addressing the following points:

- _What is the research question or problem?_

  What is your research exploring, or is the pain point you want to solve, or the new capability you want to enable.

- _What existing understanding of the problem has been developed?_

  For a research proposal, this will briefly cover related work in the space you are exploring.
  We expect similar for a design proposal, but may be more informed by mainstream media or the team's intuition.
  
- _What might the group plan to accomplish?_
 
  Given the above, what might a group plan to do in the context of this project?
  If students choose to work on this project, they will need to define milestones.
  Convey initial thoughts on appropriate milestones that will allow a group to quickly get started
  and ultimately make this an interesting and tractable project.
  
- _What might the group explicit decide to omit?_
 
  This class happens on a very aggressive timeline.
  Given that, what aspects of the problem might you choose to ignore in a research study or prototype?
  For a design project, what might you mock or otherwise omit from their prototype?
  For some projects, this might be a large piece of the overall vision.
  For other projects, a full implementation or study might be easily in-scope.
  Either is potentially appropriate, but convey explicit thoughts regarding this.

Please submit your document as a PDF.

### Presentation

On Tuesday, January 12, 2016 each group will give a brief presentation on their proposal.
This will be the first opportunity to get feedback from course staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same points as the written document.

Please upload no more than `three` slides for your presentation in .pptx.

# Project progress reports and presentations

Due: Uploaded the night before class Tuesday, January 26, 2016 and Thursday, February 23, 2016

Twice during the quarter are progress reports on your projects.
These serve as a check on the trajectory of your project and an opportunity for peer feedback.
They should convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.
Similar to the proposal, progress reports consist of a written document and a presentation.

### Written document

Please prepare an approximately one-page document addressing the following points:

- What you have done since the last proposal or milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans for this milestone
- What you will do before your next milestone, including any adaptations you will make based on your findings or project state
- Any areas where you could use advice or are blocked

Please submit your document as a PDF.

### Presentation

Your presentation should cover the same points as the written document, with emphasis on providing awareness to and receiving feedback from your peers. Presentations will be `short`, but will include time for questions.

These do not need to be structured as a formal presentation. Please submit your slides in .pptx.

# Final report

Due: Uploaded by the end of the exam period, noon on Monday, March 14, 2016

The report should have the same general structure as a full [CHI](http://chi2016.acm.org/wp/) paper, including an introduction (what is the problem you're trying to solve or research question you're trying to answer?), a description of related work, a methods section that describes the methods you used, results, a conclusion, and (if appropriate) possible directions for further work.
The paper should be 4-10 pages excluding references (longer if necessary but please try to avoid going over 10 pages).
Please use the [SIGCHI Document Format](https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats) for text and references.

Jake Wobbrock recently wrote a [writing guide for CHI-style papers](http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/Wobbrock-2015.pdf).
