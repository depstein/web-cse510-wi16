# Description

You will gain basic familiarity with analyzing experiments using mixed‑model analyses of variance in either the JMP or R statistical packages. Consistent with lecture, this assignment is not intended to provide complete knowledge of how to design or analyze experiments (a topic far beyond the scope of one lecture or assignment). This assignment is instead focused on a pragmatic introduction to analyzing experiments based in designs you might later find useful. Please consider this assignment in the context of the material covered in lecture, as not all of it is repeated here.

In addition to the lecture material and the contents of this assignment, you might benefit from working through the first four sections of [Practical Statistics for Human-Computer Interaction](//depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/proj/ps4hci/), an independent study created by Jacob Wobbrock.
